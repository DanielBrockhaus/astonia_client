
Astonia To-Do List
==================

Bugs
----

- Shaded text in 2X has single pixel gaps.

- Handle empty sprites (texture cannot dimensions cannot be 0)


Soon
----

- put all logging (crash log, sdlt.txt, etc.) in main/logs

- gs2 / fs2 to break up monotony of the new walls and floors

- Optionally turn the minimap and map by 45°.

- add N E S W to the big map

- A nice QoL change around stats now that have have tooltips could be when hovering over each
  stat display a tooltip that shows information such as current max mod, amount of mods added
  from equipment, percentage exp to raise

- Multi-Monitor support (command line option to determine on which monitor the game window is opened).

- Find an up-scaling algorithm that works with floor and wall tiles without creating edges around the tiles.
- ... or, add a list of all non-tile sprites to do_smoothify().

- Create the bigger fonts, not just use the pixel-doubled ones.

- Lighting calculations are better now, but not completely right. Fix them again. Re-add shaded lighting for items.

- Save map data, reload once the client recognizes it.

Possibly
--------

- Continue cleanup of GUI. Use DOTs instead of hardcoded pixel positions.

- Port the winsock stuff to SDL_net

- Add stuff to the client window to make it 960 pixels wide to fill a standard 16:9 display.

- Create mod for V3.5.

- Also is it possible to have a way to bind the space bar key? And is it possible to bind the stop
  action (currently 'esc' to another key). it'd be great to also have the toggles for fast/normal/stealth
  mode on the mousewheel now that there's no mouse menu e.g. mouse up for fast mode, down to bring it back
  to normal and down again to stealth


Maybe Later: Bugs
-----------------

- originx and originy are not correctly set for prefetch.

- Dragged help window should disable mouse-overs and buttons in top bar.



Maybe Later
-----------

- Redo the part of the character sprite tutorial that use the discontinued keyMate. Use the standard timeline instead.

- Move all parts of the client into separate windows, including the different chat channels.

- A Linux port. Once all is SDL it should be possible.


Server Patches
--------------

- Add "log_char(cn,LOG_SYSTEM,0,"°c5.");" to the very end of int look_item() in tool.c.
