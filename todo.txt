
Astonia To-Do List
==================


Bugs
----

- There was an instance of a failed memory tail check in SDL_MEM_PIXEL (before splitting it into PIXEL and PIXEL2).

- originx and originy are not correctly set for prefetch.

- Shaded text in 2X has single pixel gaps.


Probably
--------

- Command line option for server port.

- Continue cleanup of GUI. Use DOTs instead of hardcoded pixel positions.

- Find an up-scaling algorithm that works with floor and wall tiles without creating edges around the tiles.
- ... or, add a list of all non-tile sprites to do_smoothify().

- Create the bigger fonts, not just use the pixel-doubled ones.

- Lighting calculations have been wrong all the time. This really becomes apparent in the higher resolutions. Fix them.

- Move all resources to a single resources folder. Duh.

- Create mod for V3.5.


Possibly
--------

- Add stuff to the client window to make it 960 pixels wide to fill a standard 16:9 display.

- Add configuration files for:
  - Pretty much everything in sprite.c
  - Everything in skill.c

- Implement a control scheme that works without shift and control.

- Port the winsock stuff to SDL_net

- A Linux port. Once all is SDL it should be possible.

- Clean up the sources. Less header files. Merge dd.c and sdl.c? Or make a sharper cut.


Maybe Later
-----------

- Move all parts of the client into separate windows, including the different chat channels.
