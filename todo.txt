==================


Bugs
----

- Invisible floor tiles in Ice Pents show an outline. Lighting? Scaling?


Probably
--------

- Resize the client window to 800x540 to allow doubling the resolution on standard 2K displays.

- Find an up-scaling algorithm that works with floor and wall tiles without creating edges around the tiles.
- ... or, add a list of all non-tile sprites to do_smoothify().

- Create the bigger fonts, not just use the pixel-doubled ones.

- Lighting calculations have been wrong all the time. This really becomes apparent in the higher resolutions. Fix them.


Possibly
--------

- Add stuff to the client window to make it 960 pixels wide to fill a standard 19:10 display.

- Add configuration files for:
  - Pretty much everything in sprite.c
  - Everything in skill.c

- New .PAK file format

- Implement a control scheme that works without shift and control.

- Improve prefetch logic to take advantage of multi-threading to speed up sdl_make().

Maybe Later
-----------

- Move all parts of the client into separate windows, including the different chat channels.
