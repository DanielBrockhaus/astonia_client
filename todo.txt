
Astonia To-Do List
==================


Probably
--------

- Resize the client window to 800x540 to allow doubling the resolution on standard 2K displays.

- Add multi-core pre-rendering of textures to speed up sdl_make().

Possibly
--------

- Add stuff to the client window to make it 960 pixels wide to fill a standard 19:10 display.

- Add configuration files for:
  - Pretty much everything in sprite.c
  - Everything in skill.c

- New .PAK file format

- Implement a control scheme that works without shift and control.


Maybe Later
-----------

- Move all parts of the client into separate windows, including the different chat channels.
