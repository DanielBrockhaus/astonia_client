
Astonia To-Do List
==================

Bugs
----

- Shaded text in 2X has single pixel gaps.


Soon
----

- Old mouse wheel code as an option

- Multi-Monitor support (command line option to determine on which monitor the game window is opened).

- Find an up-scaling algorithm that works with floor and wall tiles without creating edges around the tiles.
- ... or, add a list of all non-tile sprites to do_smoothify().

- Create the bigger fonts, not just use the pixel-doubled ones.

- Lighting calculations are better now, but not completely right. Fix them again. Re-add shaded lighting for items.


Possibly
--------

- Continue cleanup of GUI. Use DOTs instead of hardcoded pixel positions.

- Command line option for server port.

- Port the winsock stuff to SDL_net

- Add stuff to the client window to make it 960 pixels wide to fill a standard 16:9 display.

- Create mod for V3.5.


Maybe Later: Bugs
-----------------

- originx and originy are not correctly set for prefetch.

- Dragged help window should disable mouse-overs and buttons in top bar.



Maybe Later
-----------

- Redo the part of the character sprite tutorial that use the discontinued keyMate. Use the standard timeline instead.

- Move all parts of the client into separate windows, including the different chat channels.

- A Linux port. Once all is SDL it should be possible.


Server Patches
--------------

- Add "log_char(cn,LOG_SYSTEM,0,"°c5.");" to the very end of int look_item() in tool.c.
