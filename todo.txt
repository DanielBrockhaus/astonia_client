
Astonia To-Do List
==================


Bugs
----

- Invisible floor tiles in Ice Pents show an outline. Lighting? Scaling?

- There was an instance of a failed memory tail check in SDL_MEM_PIXEL (before splitting it into PIXEL and PIXEL2).


Probably
--------

- Resize the client window to 800x540 to allow doubling the resolution on standard 2K displays.

- Find an up-scaling algorithm that works with floor and wall tiles without creating edges around the tiles.
- ... or, add a list of all non-tile sprites to do_smoothify().

- Create the bigger fonts, not just use the pixel-doubled ones.

- Lighting calculations have been wrong all the time. This really becomes apparent in the higher resolutions. Fix them.

- Move all resources to a single resources folder. Duh.

- Copy mouse scroll wheel functionality from V3.5

- Improve prefetch logic to take advantage of multi-threading to speed up sdl_make().


Possibly
--------

- Add stuff to the client window to make it 960 pixels wide to fill a standard 16:9 display.

- Add configuration files for:
  - Pretty much everything in sprite.c
  - Everything in skill.c

- Implement a control scheme that works without shift and control.

- Port the winsock stuff to SDL_net

- A Linux port. Once all is SDL it should be possible.

- Clean up the sources. Less header files. Merge dd.c and sdl.c? Or make a sharper cut.


Maybe Later
-----------

- Move all parts of the client into separate windows, including the different chat channels.
