3rd Party Copyright Notices:

The action icons (sprites 800 to 899) are from a Humble Bundle called
"Dev Icons", and you will need to replace them, or buy your own license.

If you still use the images from Luis Royo (Girl with Golem, Lady with Sword.
They were used for a lot of the old advertisements and were part of the front
wepage). You will also need a license for those.

To the best of my knowledge tverything else is free for 3rd party rights.
However, I do NOT GUARANTEE that this is the case!
